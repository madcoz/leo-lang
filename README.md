leo programming language

The leo (LEOpard) programming language is a language with C-like syntax
that is invented to get a better understanding for programming language.

This programming language has strong-type checking with duck-typing support.
At the first phase, I will implement the leo bootstrap compiler with C++.
At the second phase, I will try to implement the self-host compiler with leo language.
At the third phase, I will try to add package or module support for this language.

This is just a side project of mine, that I would like to understand more of compilers
and programming languages.

Currently, it is still in its infancy.

Hopefully, it will become a powerful compiler that I can use to implement big projects.

For FFI, I would like to implement in SOA-like approach without embedding foreign language
source code in the leo source code.

For the current time being, feel free to look into the bootstrap folder for the first phase 
implementation.
